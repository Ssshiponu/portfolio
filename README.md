         Run this Python command in your terminal:
         ```sh
         python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
         ```
         Copy the generated key. (use `ctrl+shift+c` for copy and `ctrl+shift+v` to copy, pest if tradetional method doesn't work)

    2. **Set the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable:**

         - **Windows (Command Prompt):**
             ```sh
             set SECRET_KEY=your_generated_secret_key
             ```
         - **Windows (PowerShell):**
             ```sh
             $env:SECRET_KEY="your_generated_secret_key"
             ```
         - **macOS/Linux:**
             ```sh
             export SECRET_KEY=your_generated_secret_key
             ```

- (Optional) Create a `.env` file in your project root:
    ```
    SECRET_KEY=your_generated_secret_key
    ```

7. **Collect static files**
   ```sh
   python manage.py collectstatic
   ```

8. **Run the server**
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Deploying to PythonAnywhere

1. **Upload your project**  
   - Zip your project folder (excluding `venv` and unnecessary files) and upload it to your PythonAnywhere account, or use Git.

2. **Set up a virtual environment on PythonAnywhere**  
   - Go to the "Consoles" tab, start a Bash console, and run:
     ```sh
     mkvirtualenv portfolio-venv --python=python3.12
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Configure your web app**  
   - Go to the "Web" tab and set:
     - **Source code**: Path to your project (where `manage.py` is located)
     - **Virtualenv**: Path to your virtualenv (e.g., `/home/yourusername/.virtualenvs/portfolio-venv`)
     - **WSGI configuration file**: Edit to point to your Django projectâ€™s WSGI application:
       ```python
       import sys
       path = '/home/yourusername/portfolio'
       if path not in sys.path:
           sys.path.append(path)
       from portfolio.wsgi import application
       ```

4. **Set environment variables**  
   - In the "Web" tab, add your `SECRET_KEY` as an environment variable.
   - Check Local Installation section to get a `SECRET_KEY`

5. **Set Django settings for production**  
   - In `portfolio/settings.py`:
     - Set `DEBUG = False`
     - Set `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your-username.pythonanywhere.com']`
     - Uncomment `STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'static'` and comment `STATICFILES_DIRS = [ BASE_DIR / "static", ]`

6. **Collect static files**
   ```sh
   python manage.py collectstatic
   ```

9. **Reload your PythonAnywhere web app**  
   - Click "Reload" in the "Web" tab.
